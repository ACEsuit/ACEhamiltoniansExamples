    "## Preface\n",
    "It is important to note that the `ACEhamiltonians` codebase is under rapid development and is thus subject to change. The version of `ACEhamiltonians` used in this notebook represents a static snapshot taken of the code as the time the paper entitled [_Equivariant analytical mapping of first principles Hamiltonians to accurate and transferable materials models_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13736) was released. This notebook provides brief guide on how the code, as it was used in the paper, can be run; and is primarily intended to allow for external validation. User that wish to make use of the `ACEhamiltonians` codebase, and its associated projects, in a more directed capacity should use the release version, [located here](https://github.com/ACEsuit/ACEhamiltonians.jl).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "This section walks through how to correctly setup and configure an `ACEhamiltonians` compatible Julia environment. This task only needs to be performed once per-user, per-system. To start with, the [`ACEsuit`](https://github.com/ACEsuit) registry must be added to the registry list so that Julia can access and download the packages upon which `ACEhamiltonians` is based. Once this is done, the `ACEhamiltonians` package can be downloaded and initialised. Following this, `ACEhamiltonians` can be imported as `ACE2tb`."

    "## Using ACEhamiltonians\n",
    "This section provides an introduction to the `ACEhamiltonians` code and how one can build, fit, validate the models it produces. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Parameters\n",
    "The `ACE` bases need to be carefully chosen for each specific application. Larger bases can achieve higher accuracy but have a greater risk of losing transferability due to overfitting. Each basis is defined by three parameters, the correlation order _ν_, and the two maximum polynomial degrees _n<sub>max</sub>_ and _l<sub>max</sub>_. The former controls the body-order of the basis while the latter two are used in the radial and angular basis functions. These parameters are specified via a pair of `Params` structures, one for the on-site bases and another for the off-site bases. `ACEhamiltonians` will then used the parameters contained within these structures to construct and fit the model. Parameter must be supplied for each and every basis function; and while such parameters can be freely chosen by the user the number of basis functions is always fixed. This is because the version of `ACEhamiltonians` used in this workbook is hardcoded to model aluminum systems using a _3s2p1d_ basis-set. A restriction that is removed in the release versions. The required `Params` structures can be instantiated by providing the `Params` constructors with the following six arguments (the exact form of which will be discussed later):\n",
    " - `r_cut`: the cutoff distance controls the near/far-sightedness of the on-site `ACE` bases and the interaction cutoff distance of the off-site interactions (Note that for off-site interactions the `ACE` basis environmental cutoff is internally set to one half the specified interaction distance).\n",
    " - `mpd`: the maximum polynomial degrees i.e. `mpd` ≡ _n<sub>max</sub>_ ≡ _l<sub>max</sub>_.\n",
    " - `ν`: the correlation order controls the body-order of the bases; body-order works out to be `mpd+1` & `mpd+2` for on/off-site bases respectively; i.e. using a global `mpd` value of 1 will result in all on-site interactions being two body and all off-site interactions being three body.\n",
    " - `λ`: regularisation values; these values, commonly around 1E-7, control the extent of regularisation used when calculating the coefficients during the fitting process. Larger values result in more aggressive regularisation.\n",
    " - `reg_type`: the type of regularisation to use; `1` for ridge regression and `2` for Tikhonov regularization (recommended).\n",
    " - `solver`: specifies which solver should be used during fitting; options are `\"LSQR\"` (recommended), `\"QR\"`, and `\"NaiveSolver\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first four arguments must be vectors of matrices rather than single values; this is because the user must specify one parameter for each and every basis. When specifying on-site parameters six matrices are required like so: \n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "some_on_site_parameter = Vector{\n",
    "    Matrix{3,3}, # ss parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{2,3}, # sp parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{1,3}, # sd parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{2,2}, # pp parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{1,2}, # pd parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{1,1}  # dd parameters\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first matrix represents the parameters to be used for the bases representing the interactions between the three sharp bases; the values from top-left to bottom right should be parameters for the s<sub>1</sub>s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>1</sub>s<sub>2</sub>, s<sub>1</sub>s<sub>3</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>s<sub>3</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>s<sub>2</sub>, ... s<sub>3</sub>s<sub>3</sub> `ACE` bases. The second matrix represents interactions between the three sharp bases and the two primitive bases, and so on and so forth. For the off-site parameters a total of nine matrices are required:\n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "some_off_site_parameter = Vector{\n",
    "    Matrix{3,3}, # ss parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{2,3}, # sp parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{1,3}, # sd parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{3,2}, # ps parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{2,2}, # pp parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{1,2}, # pd parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{3,1}, # ds parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{2,1}, # dp parameters\n",
    "    Matrix{1,1}  # dd parameters\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is **strongly** advised to ensure that the parameter matrices of conjugate interactions are symmetrically equivalent, i.e. the off-site sp parameter matrix is equal to the transpose of the ps parameter matrix. Note that only a single value is to be provided for the last two arguments, `reg_type` and `solver`, as they are applied to all bases. The following code block constructs the `Params` as used in the paper."

    "#### The Data\n",
    "Now that the parameters of the model have been defined, the data on which it is to be fitted must be chosen. This is done through the use of the `Data` structure which. The `Data` structure takes two arguments `file_names` and `atom_blocks`. The former argument provides a list of HDF5 files from which to extract data. Each file should contain the results of exactly one DFT reference calculation and should be structured according to the outline given in the appendix. The latter argument specifies from which atom-blocks fitting data should be taken, this is done to avoid fitting on redundant data as is commonly found in Hamiltonian matrices produced from supercell calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For off-site `Data` structures a block is specified by a tuple of atomic indices like so `(i, j)`, where `(1, 2)` would indicate the atom-block associated with the interaction between atoms 1 and 2. For on-site `Data` structures only a single index is required per-block as they always lie on the diagonal, thus `i` will resolve to `(i, i)` internally. It is worth pointing out that the `Data` object does not actually load any data only tells lower levels of the code which files and atom-blocks are to be used during fitting. The actual loading of the data and Hamiltonian vs overlap matrix selection is done by the code as and when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `atom_blocks` is a vector of vectors, then it is assumed that the i'th vector in `atom_blocks` specifies the atom-blocks to be extracted from the i'th file in `file_names`. However, if `atom_blocks` is a single vector then it is assumed that those atom-blocks should be extracted from all files.
